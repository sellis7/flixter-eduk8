	<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
	<hr />
	<p>
		Privacy. It's important to you and it's important to me. In this day and age with technology being as advanced and ever-present as it is, there is ease of access to information about almost everyone and everything. For the most part, that's good. But there will always be those that abuse information they can acquire, unfortunately. This website was not established with that intent or for that purpose.
	</p>
	<p>
		Though this isn't a true "privacy policy", it serves to provide some general information about the functionality of this site, and information used to interact and experiement with it as a user.
	</p>
	<p>
		This website is for functional demonstration, only. This website will not maintain information other than provided email addresses entered to establish a user account. Email addresses provided do not need to be authentic to access this site or its functionality. Should you forget your generated password, the email functionality has been disabled to avoid spamming. There is no way to update or retrieve your password.
	</p>
	<p>
		You will not be charged or billed when enrolling for a course, as that functionality has been disabled. Payment functionality was established by integrating <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/checkout">Stripe</a> in test (or demo) mode. Simply enter <kbd>4242 4242 4242 4242</kbd> as a card number, if you wish to experiement with the enrollment functionality of this website.
	</p>
	<p><b>Please note:</b> This website will be monitored from time to time, and any and all harmful, malicious, vulgar or irrelevant entries and uploads <em>will be removed</em>. 
	</p>
	<p>This is a work-in-progress, and may be extended upon implementation of additional features and functionality.
